My own realization of Conway's Game of Life.
I use cicled list of cicled lists (my own) for matrix. Also matplotlib for result animation.
Project include some not my realization â€” i use it fo test and learning. In future it will be unnecessary.
My files: CicledList.py, LifeGame.py, Matplotlib Test 2.py; AllInOne.py for Stepik course.
